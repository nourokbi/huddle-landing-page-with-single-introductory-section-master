- Responsive Web Design
- New CSS Syntax and properties
- ems and rems used (first time)

### What I learned

I learned to think responsivly by look at the design first in a wide look before just writing HTML & CSS, I also learned some tricks in how to make background for a section in different way, i used Rem and em to make a resposive units.


### Continued development

i wish to learn transitions, animations, box-shadow and grid system to have a good base in HTML & CSS, Then (or will learn them parallel) learn JS and complete in the roadmap of being a Frontend Developer as a start.
